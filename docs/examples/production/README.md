# Production examples
The examples in the folder follow a hypothetical production called "**Blinko**", as it moves through the Cinema Content Creation Cloud from screenplay, through preproduction, production, post production, delivery, initial release, archive, restoration, and a second directors cut release.

These examples show how the c4 language description of the project evolves over time, and how the framework can make many common production tasks much easier and more cost effective using 'cloud' and other remote resources. See the other example folders for demonstrations of c4 from different points of view, such a providing services, studio project management, and digital artists.

_(Note: `*.c4.md` files are parse-able c4 file that are self documented in markdown.)_
