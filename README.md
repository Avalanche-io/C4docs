# C4 Interface

This is the open source project for the C4 Interface, a standardized framework for film, television and general media content production in the cloud.

For more detailed information see the [C4 Interface Specification](https://github.com/JoshuaKolden/C4/docs/spec.md).

## Project Plans

This project it intended to outline the the basic requirements for the C4 Interface, provide a reference client implementation, language bindings, and a test framework to drive client development and evaluate interface compliance in new implementations.

This work is being done in collaboration with the [ETC Cloud Project](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Milk).

## Contributing

Contribution is encouraged from both programmers and non programmers who have expertise to share.  To facilitate this we uses Behavior Driven Development (BDD) and easy to understand English language descriptions of features.

If you are not a programmer or not familiar with BDD then you might find this video helpful: [What is BDD and why should I care?](http://vimeo.com/72673788)

Please add an [issue](https://github.com/JoshuaKolden/C4Interface/issues) if you have ideas, or fork the project and implement code that satisfies test requirements.
